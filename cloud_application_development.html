            <h2>1. Description of Prototype Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>CloudScholar</strong> is a cloud-based platform designed to transform lecture recordings or transcripts into
                powerful study tools, addressing common challenges faced by students such as fast-paced lectures, inefficient
                note-taking, and the lack of personalised study aids. By integrating advanced features, CloudScholar provides
                students with an efficient and user-friendly way to manage and optimise their learning process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The platform offers seamless and secure user management. New users can easily register by creating unique
                accounts with essential credentials. Once registered, they can log in to access the platform, ensuring a
                personalised and secure experience. Users can update their account information, including usernames and
                passwords, whenever necessary to maintain accuracy and security. Additionally, a logout function enables users
                to safely end their sessions, protecting their personal information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once logged in, users can explore and access a variety of notes, including viewing their private notes or
                searching for other public notes by entering keywords or lecture titles, making navigation seamless and
                efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of CloudScholar’s standout functionalities is its ability to auto-generate structured notes from lecture
                recordings. Users can create lectures by uploading lecture transcripts, and WAV files, or recording lectures in
                real time. The application processes this input to create concise, summarised notes, highlighting key points and
                organising the content effectively. Users can edit their notes at any time for better organisation and
                customisation, with the option to store them publicly or privately. These notes are securely stored in the
                database and are accessible only to registered users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building upon these notes, CloudScholar generates flashcards designed to enhance active learning and memory
                retention. These flashcards are accessible at any time and are available for export, enabling users to review and
                reinforce their understanding of the lecture material.
            </p>
            <p>
                To deepen the learning experience further, CloudScholar allows users to take unique quizzes that are generated
                based on flashcards, providing a dynamic and interactive way for users to test their knowledge and improve
                comprehension. Each quiz is timed and questions are newly created every time a quiz is attempted, ensuring that
                no two quizzes are alike to prevent rote memorization and encourage a deeper understanding of the material. Users
                are free to navigate between questions during the quiz. After taking the quiz, users can view their quiz results
                and scores to assess their performance and identify improvement areas. Users would have the option to save quiz
                reports for future reference. Quiz scores are stored in the database and the latest score will be displayed. For
                public lectures, the scores of all attempted users are displayed on leaderboards and podiums, fostering a
                competitive and collaborative learning environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The COSMOS database securely stores all user accounts and lecture-related data. This includes lecture titles,
                generated notes, flashcards, tags and quiz scores, ensuring that all user data is well-organised and easily
                retrievable.
            </p>
            <p>
                By integrating these features, CloudScholar empowers students to transform their learning experience, fostering
                better comprehension, retention, and academic success.

            <h2>2. Brief Overview of Design and Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                In our prototype, the frontend and backend have been designed as independent components to maintain a clear
                separation of responsibilities.
            </p>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>2.1 Frontend</h3>
                <p>
                    Our frontend is developed as a responsive web application using Vue.js. We decided to use Vue CLI due to its
                    simplicity and flexibility, which allowed us to structure into distinct directories, including components,
                    views, routers, stores, and assets. The components folder contains reusable elements such as the navigation bar
                    for easy reuse. The application is organised into multiple pages which are stored in the views folder. The
                    application’s main pages include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Welcome Page: First page visited, includes options to Register or Login.</li>
                    <li>Register Page: Allows users to register and automatically log into the application.the</li>
                    <li>Login Page: Allows users to log into the application.</li>
                    <li>Main Page: Provide option to create lecture, access to view recent/popular/private lectures and search for public lectures using keywords.</li>
                    <li>Lecture Note Page: users can view and edit selected lecture notes, or select options to view flashcards, take a quiz, or view the lecture’s leaderboard.</li>
                    <li>Flashcards Page: To view flashcards one by one.</li>
                    <li>Quiz Page: To take a quiz on the lecture.</li>
                    <li>Leaderboard Page: To view the score of other users or your latest score.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Routing was managed through the router/index.js file, where we defined paths for navigation between views. State
                    management was centralised using Vuex, with the store/index.js file facilitating global state sharing and
                    maintaining consistency across components.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>2.2 Backend</h3>
                <p>
                    The backend is an Azure function app, where the functions are called through an API. The functions in the
                    backend allow for access to the Azure services that are required for CloudScholar. The services are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>COSMOSDB:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Registering a new account, if valid, will add the details to the database.</li>
                            <li>Logging in will check in the database if the credentials are correct.</li>
                            <li>Newly created lectures and all it’s contents are added to the database.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>OPEN AI:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Generates the initial notes from the imported transcripts.</li>
                            <li>Generates the flashcards from the notes.</li>
                            <li>Generates the quiz derived from the notes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>AZURE SPEECH:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Responsible for converting the WAV file to the transcript to generate notes from the recorded transcripts.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These services combine to store credentials, maintain lecture data, and deliver AI-generated study aids through a
                    secure, scalable architecture.
